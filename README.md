Qu-View is an interactive multi-qubit state visualizer that helps users build, simulate, and understand quantum circuits in real time.
It is developed using Streamlit for the user interface, Qiskit for quantum circuit simulation, Plotly for Bloch sphere visualization, and integrated with OpenAI’s GPT-based chatbot for guided quantum assistance.
